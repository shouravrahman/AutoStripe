🚀 SaaS Idea: “StripeSyncer”

Tagline:
Instantly set up LemonSqueezy and Stripe products, plans, and webhooks for your new SaaS — in one click.

🧩 Core Problem

Setting up a new SaaS often means repeating:

Creating products and variants in LemonSqueezy / Stripe

Entering name, description, price, interval, trial, etc.

Copying product and price IDs to your backend

Setting up webhooks manually

Adding payment links or checkout embeds

This is slow, error-prone, and non-scalable when you’re building multiple SaaS projects.

💡 Core Solution

A web app that automates the entire payment setup for both LemonSqueezy and Stripe, from a single dashboard or API.

You enter:

Product name (e.g. “AI Resume Writer”)

Plans (Free, Pro, Lifetime, Custom tiers)

Billing frequency, price, trial, etc.

The app then:

Creates the product & plans automatically via API

Syncs them across LemonSqueezy + Stripe (optional)

Returns ready-to-use:

product IDs

checkout URLs

webhook endpoints

embed snippets

Basically, a “payment config generator.”

⚙️ Tech Architecture

Next.js (with Auth & clean dashboard)

Tailwind UI

Optional: React Hook Form + Zod for schema-safe plan creation

Backend

Node.js / Next API Routes or Fastify

Integrations:

LemonSqueezy API

Stripe API

PostgreSQL or Supabase for user configs & generated setups

Copy or download JSON config for your SaaS project

Dashboard with all your products & plans

Advanced (Pro Tier)

One-click “Sync across Stripe + LemonSqueezy”

Generate ready-to-use payment component snippets (React/Next.js/Node)

Webhook auto-setup wizard

Bulk product cloning

Template library (e.g. “3-tier SaaS template”, “Freemium model”, “Lifetime deal setup”)

CLI tool (e.g. stripesyncer init)

🧰 Bonus Developer Tools

API + SDK (for devs who want to script it)

JSON-based config importer:

{
  "product": "AI Writer",
  "plans": [
    { "name": "Pro", "price": 29, "interval": "month" },
    { "name": "Lifetime", "price": 199, "interval": "once" }
  ]
}


→ app auto-creates everything.

💸 Monetization

Free tier: limited setups/month or single platform

Pro: $19–29/mo for unlimited Stripe + LemonSqueezy setups
